Introduction

A comprehensive list of websites providing awesome datasets for research/practical purposes in network and network security


Datasets
-------
- [UNB](http://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/index.html) **Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity** *Very complete list of available datasets in Malware/Botnet/...* 

- [CAIDA](https://www.caida.org/data/overview/) **Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis** *CAIDA collects several different types of data at geographically and topologically diverse locations, and makes this data available to the research community to the extent possible while preserving the privacy of individuals and organizations who donate data or network access.* 

- [Wireshark](https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures) **Sample Captured network traffic** *WIRESHARK* 

- [GHDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/) **Google Hacking Database (GHDB)** *GHDB is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting, and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases, this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine which subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.* 

- [GHDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/11/) **GHDB - Network or Vulnerability Data** *These pages contain such things as firewall logs, honeypot logs, network information, IDS logs... All sorts of fun stuff!* 

- [Netresec](http://www.netresec.com/?page=PcapFiles) **Publicly available PCAP files** *This is a list of public packet capture repositories, which are freely available on the Internet. Most of the sites listed below share Full Packet Capture (FPC) files, but some do unfortunately only have truncated frames.*
